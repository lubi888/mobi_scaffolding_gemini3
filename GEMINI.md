# Gemini Code Assistant Context

This document provides context for the Gemini Code Assistant to understand the `mobi_scaffolding_gemini3` project.

## Project Overview

`mobi_scaffolding_gemini3` is a Flutter project that serves as a starting point for future applications. It was generated by the Gemini CLI and is based on the standard Flutter counter app template. The goal is to create a reusable scaffolding that can be easily extended.

**Technologies:**

*   Flutter
*   Dart

**Project Structure:**

*   `lib/main.dart`: The main entry point of the application.
*   `pubspec.yaml`: Defines project dependencies and metadata.
*   `test/`: Contains application tests.
*   Platform-specific directories (`android`, `ios`, `linux`, `macos`, `web`, `windows`): Contain platform-specific code and configuration.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

*   Flutter SDK: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
*   A configured IDE (like VS Code or Android Studio) or a terminal with the `flutter` command available.

### Running the App

To run the application, use the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
flutter run
```

You can target a specific device by using the `-d` flag:

```bash
flutter run -d <device_id>
```

To see a list of available devices, run:

```bash
flutter devices
```

### Building the App

To build a release version of the app, use the following command:

```bash
flutter build <platform>
```

Replace `<platform>` with the desired platform (e.g., `apk`, `appbundle`, `ios`, `linux`, `macos`, `web`, `windows`).

## Development Conventions

### Testing

The project includes a default widget test in `test/widget_test.dart`. To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
flutter test
```

### Linting

The project uses `flutter_lints` to enforce code quality. The linting rules are defined in `analysis_options.yaml`. To analyze the code for any linting issues, run:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

### Contribution Guidelines

*   Follow the existing coding style.
*   Write tests for new features.
*   Ensure that all tests and linter checks pass before submitting code.
